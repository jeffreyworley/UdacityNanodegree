        <u><b>WWW or the World Wide Web:</b></u>
        <p>   
          &emsp;The World Wide web is a collection of HTML (Hypertext markup language) documents. However, any type of file can exist on the web. The web works by using hyperlinks to connect HTML files to other HTML files.

        <u><b>Major Pieces of the Internet</b></u>
        <br>
        <p>
           &emsp;There are a few main pieces that are required to connect you to the internet. these are you, your computer, your browser, internet connection, and servers. you make a request to your computer on your browser to access a web page. Your browser then connects to the server that hosts the web page you want to access through the internet. The data is transfered to your computer where it is displayed on your browser.

        <u><b>HTML</b></u>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;HTML is made up of text content, markup, references to other documents, and links to other pages. HTML markup consists of tags that are used to change and manipulate the text and control the aspects of the document.The references to other documents and links to other pages are what makes the internet, the internet. It connects all the web pages together for a user to access.

        <u><b>HTML Tags</b></u>
        <br>
        <p>
          HTML Tags look like this:
          <br>  
          &emsp;tag name&gt; contents &lt;/tag name&gt;
          <br>
          <br>  
          &emsp;Tags serve many purposes such as italicizing text, bolding text, creating hyperlinks on text, and any other text manipulation. Tags also can include links for pictures to render in the HTML document.

        <u><b>Computers are stupid</b></u>
        <p>
          &emsp;I, as many other programmers, have experienced the unfortunate issue of mistyping a keyword or forgetting a semicolon, or something along those lines that makes a computer do something you didn't want it to do. However, whatever the mistake was, told the computer to do just what it did. A computer has no way of understanding what you <b>meant</b> to say. It can only understand exactly what you instruct it to do.

        <u><b>Inline VS. Block elements</b></u>
        <br>
        <p>                      
          &emsp;Withing HTML tags, there is a distinction between inline tags, and block tags. Inline tags simply change the text without affecting text around it. Block tags, however, create a padded "box" around the contents of the text.

        <u><b>Structure of a Webpage Document</b></u>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;A structered document has three main elements to it, HTML, CSS, and DOM. HTML is the text and how you manipulate it. CSS is how you define or "style" the manipulation, and DOM is how one should approach thinking about a web page.
          <br>
          <br>
           &emsp;THe biggest thing about structered document is boxes. Everything in a web document is a box. This is important to know when one is planning out a wep page. It also helps in the organization process of the webpage. 
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>

        <u><b>Boxes in HTML</b></u>
        <br>
        <p>
           &emsp;Everything in HTML is treated as a box. This helps simplify the design faze, because you can easily move things around without having to worry about overlap. or mistakes. This also helps with quick re-design of webpages

        <u><b>Text Editors/ IDE's</b></u>
        <br>
        <p>
           &emsp;When programming, programmers require special text editors that ease the task of programming. These text editors do this by highlighting keyword, and overall making code more readable.

        <u><b>CSS</b></u>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;Cascading style sheet. it is what defines the “styles” of applied tags. does the most specific instruction or rule. styles are defined by classes or by tags. 
        </p>  

      </div>

      <div>

        <u><b>CSS Style</b></u>
        <p>
          &emsp;Changing the visual properties of an element only changes how the element is displayed. However it does not change the kind of element. So, use the correct tag for what you need the text to be. i.e. use a h1 tag for a header etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Changing the tag changes the semantics of the content and the look of the content.

        </p>
      </div>

      <u><b>The Box Model</b></u>
      <br>
      <p>
        &emsp;CSS has several properties. some of these include the Margin, border padding, and content. These are what can be changed and redefined to determine the box that content will sit in inside of a webpage. The following explains the parts of the box model in depth.
      </p>

      </div>

      <div>

        <u><b>Content</b></u>
        <br>
        <p>
          &emsp;Image or text that is appearing on the website. Kind of like the nucleus of the box model. The rest of the properties exist to “protect” the content from the rest of the components on the webpage. Element width is defined as the width including border, padding, and content.  
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>

      <u><b>Padding</b></u>
      <p>
        &emsp;Clears an area around the content and is effected by the background color of the box. Space inside of the box that protects the content directly.
      </p>

      </div>

      <div>

        <u><b>Border</b></u>
        <p>
          &emsp;Goes around padding and content. Inherited from color property of the box.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>

        <u><b>Margin</b></u>
        <p>
          &emsp;Clears the area around the border. No background color. completely transparent. basically the spacer between boxes.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>

        <u><b>Constant Box Sizing</b></u>
        <p>
          &emsp;by using the code box-sizing: border-box; you can always have a constant for the amount of pixels an element will span across not including margin. the only issue is that some browsers are to old to support this. So, you add browser specific prefixes. webkit, most, ms. The size of box is sometimes calculated in pixels, but you can also use a percentage. Percentage allows for a better user experience.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>

        <u><b>CSS Positioning</b></u>
        <p>
          &emsp;Css allows the developer to place everything in a very specific place. However this is extremely complicated.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>

        <u><b>FlexBox</b></u>
        <p>
          &emsp;Flexible box. provides an efficient way to lay out a line and distribute space among items in a container (div). 
        </p>
        <p>
          code: display: flex;
        </p>
      </div>
